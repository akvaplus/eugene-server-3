Home and Authentication:
- GET / - Home page with login and registration forms (toggle between them)
- POST /auth/login - Login form submission
- POST /auth/register - Registration form submission
- GET /auth/logout - Logout action

Features and Restrictions:
- User Authentication: 
  * Traditional login with username/email and password
  * Google OAuth authentication for seamless sign-in
  * All views except the home page require login
- Admin Restrictions: Only admin users can view all users (/user) and create sessions for other users. Non-admin users are restricted to their own profile and sessions.
- Session Management: Non-admin users can only create/edit sessions for themselves, with user ID hidden in forms. Admin users can manage sessions for any user.
- Email Verification: Upon registration, a verification email is sent if the email service is configured.
- Navigation: Header shows navigation options based on user authentication status and admin privileges. For logged-in users, it shows 'My Profile', 'Sessions', and 'Logout'. For admin users, 'My Profile' is replaced with 'Users' to access the full user list.
- User Deletion: Users can delete their own account, and admins can delete any user. Deletion removes the user and all associated sessions.
- API Access Logging: All access to /user/api endpoint is logged with detailed user information including username, email, and full name.

Notes:
- All redirects using 'back' have been updated to use req.get('Referrer') || '/' to address deprecation warnings.
- The system no longer uses flash messages for success or error notifications.
- Google OAuth users are automatically verified since they use a verified Google account.
- This document will be updated as the application evolves with additional features or changes.
